\title{Simultaneous confidence corridors for mean function and its derivatives of one-dimentional functional data}
\usage{
scc.1D(Ya, Yb = NULL, X = NULL, X.band = NULL, d.est = 3,
  d.cov = 3, derivs = 1, nknots.est.a = NULL, nknots.est.b = NULL,
  nknots.cov.a = 6, nknots.cov.b = NULL, alpha.grid = c(0.1, 0.05,
  0.01), nboot = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ya}{a matrix of one-dimensional dense functional data with each row corresponding to one subject.}

\item{Yb}{an optional matrix containing the second group of functional data. Default is \code{NULL}.
When \code{Yb} is \code{NULL}, a one-group SCC is constructed for the mean function or mean function's derivatives of \code{Ya},
otherwise, a two-group SCC is constructed for the difference between the mean functions of \code{Yb} and \code{Ya}.}

\item{X}{an optional vector containing locations of observations.
If not specified, the data are treated to be observed on regular grids in \code{(0,1])}.}

\item{X.band}{an optional vector specifying the locations to construct scc. If not provided, scc will be generated on \code{X}.}

\item{d.est}{degree of  B-spline for estimating mean function, default is 3 for cubic splines.}

\item{derivs}{order of mean function's derivatives to conduct scc. Default is 1.}

\item{nknots.est.a}{a vector or an integer specifying the potential numbers of knots when estimating mean function with B-spline.
Default is \code{seq(2,min(floor(na/4),20),1)}, where \code{na} is the total number of subjects in the first group.
If \code{nknots.est.a} has length more than \code{1}, then GCV is used to select the optimal number of knots.}

\item{nknots.est.b, nknots.cov.b}{optional information about spline estimation for second set of functional data.}

\item{nknots.cov.a}{an integer indicating the number of knots in each dimension when using
tensor-product splines to estimate the first group's covariance function.}

\item{alpha.grid}{vector of confidence levels. Default is \code{c(0.1,0.05,0.01)}.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstrap to simulate quantiles. Default is 1000.}

\item{d.band}{degree of B-spline on each dimension when constructing tensor-product spline smoothing for covariance function, default is 3.}
}
\description{
The function is used to construct SCC for mean function and its derivatives of one group of images or
difference of mean functions between two sets of images.
